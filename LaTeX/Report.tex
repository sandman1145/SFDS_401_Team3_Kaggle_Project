\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} Many factors can impact the sale price of residential real estate. This report will explore those various aspects to help define what factors tend to impact home prices. We start by looking at the three distinct neighborhoods (North Ames, Edwards, and Brookside) in Ames, Iowa that Century 21 Ames sells houses to help better understand how above ground living space relates to sales price in each of these neighborhoods and if the neighborhood has an impact on the sales price. At the conclusion of this analysis, we provide a conclusion that quantifies the relationship between living area and sales price with respect to these neighborhoods.
\paragraph{} After examining the impact of above ground living space on sales price for these three neighborhoods, we provide a much more complex analysis of factors that can be used to determine sales price for Ames as a whole. While we will use various methods to determine what factors are important for our predictive model, we will test this model on a blind dataset to show how it performs. The results of this model on the test data will be provided to further build the level of confidence in this tool for predicting future home sale prices.
%------------------------------------------------

\section{Data Description}
The dataset used for this analysis was retrieved from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques}{www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques}.
\paragraph{Data} The data for this evaluation contained 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. A complete description of these data can be found in Appendix ~\ref{sec:DataDescription}. The explanatory variables contain both categorical and numeric attributes.  Appendix~\ref{tab:Data}, provides a high level summary of the variables and variable types contained in this dataset.
\paragraph{Preprocessing} The variable \texttt{LotFrontage} posed a challenge since it was a continuous numerical variable that contained \texttt{NA}. This is because the variable was for the linear feet of street connected to property. In many cases (259 of 1460) this was either unknown or unrecorded. Our team made the decision to convert these NA values to 0. We believe this is an acceptable practice since we performed a sensitivity analysis by replacing the NAs with values from 0 to 140 (mean value is 70) with no impact on the linear regression model selection process and this factor was not utilized in any of our final models.
\paragraph{Training} Training of the linear regression models will be done utilizing the \texttt{training.csv} data obtained from above. A five fold cross validation will be employed for model selection. 
\paragraph{Testing} Testing of the linear regression models will be done utilizing the \texttt{test.csv} data obtained from above.
\paragraph{Results} Datafiles containing the test results of the linear regression models can be found in our Github repository at \href{https://github.com/mjwolfe91/SFDS_401_Team3_Kaggle_Project}{https://github.com/mjwolfe91/SFDS\_401\_Team3\_Kaggle\_Project}\\

\section{Analysis Question 1}
\subsection{Restatement of Problem}
\paragraph{Request} Century 21 Ames only sells houses in the Noth Ames, Edwards and Brookside neighborhoods and wants an estimate of how the sale price of the house is related to the square footage of the living area of the house. Additionally, Century 21 Ames would like to know if the sale price (and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood the house is located in. A fit a model will be used to answer this question.
\paragraph{Deliverable} Provide the estimate (or estimates if it varies by neighborhood) as well as confidence intervals for any estimate(s) you provide. Provide evidence that the model assumptions are met and that any suspicious observations (outliers / influential observations) have been identified and addressed. Finally, a conclusion that quantifies the relationship between living area and sale price with respect to these three neighborhoods.
\subsection{Build and Fit the Model}
\paragraph{} Listing~\ref{lst:Analysis1Source} of Appendix~\ref{sec:Analysis1} contains the SAS code used to check the assumptions, clean the data, and run the model to determine the best estimate for sale price based on square footage for the North Ames, Edwards, and Brookside neighborhoods. We removed four data points from the original dataset due to being outliers. First sale prices greater than \$300,000 were determined to not be representative of the total population of these three neighborhoods. Second, sale condition was limited to only those that were normal sales. Again we feel that home sales that were not normal sales such as foreclosures, linked properties, and land purchases were not representative of the population of interest.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Checking Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\paragraph{Linearity} The linearity assumption is met by the reviewing the scatter plots associated with data. Fig ~\ref{fig:A1LR} shows a plot of SalePrice vs. GrLivArea and by removing the outliers the linearity assumption is reasonably met. 
\paragraph{Constant Variance} The residual plot, Fig ~\ref{fig:A1RP} resembles somewhat of a random scatter of points around the 0 line, although there is a slight suspicion of non-constant variance judging from the dense cloud around the predicted value of \$130,000. Also shown is the Studentized Residual Plot which is very similar to the residual plot, although this plot identifies potential outlying observations.
\paragraph{Normality} Based upon the histograms and q-q plots in Fig ~\ref{fig:A1QQ} there is no evidence to suggest against the normality of the data. Additionally the random scatter associated with the residual plots in Fig ~\ref{fig:A1RP} also support the normality assumption.
\paragraph{Independence} The independence assumption can be assumed to be maintained since these are all unique sales in a free housing market. 
\subsubsection{Outliers and Influential Points}
\paragraph{outliers / influential observations} There are distinct outliers that can be seen both in the Cook's D and Outlier and Leverage Diagnostics seen in Fig ~\ref{fig:A1IP}. By removing the observations that resulted from non-normal sales conditions such as foreclosures and sale prices that were significantly outside the population, the Cook's D and Outlier and Leverage Diagnostics significantly improved. We are confident that the removal of these observations was appropriate since they do not represent the population as a whole. Additionally we are confident that the remaining data does not contain significant outliers or leverage points that need to be addressed further.
\paragraph{}The model is a reasonable fit without transformations.  The removal of observations not reflective of the population, such as non-normal sale conditions and home sales greater than \$300,000, seems appropriate and enables the required model assumptions to be met.

\subsubsection{Effect by Neighborhood}
\paragraph{Model} A model was developed to individually look at the neighborhoods of interest to determine if the sale price is impacted by neighborhood. Fig ~\ref{fig:NBscat} shows the sales price vs living area by neighborhood. The model shows (Table~\ref{tab:SMM}) that the intercept and slope for Brookside and Edwards do differ from North Ames with statistical significance (p-values: $<.0001$ and $.0077$). As such we have determined to choose this model which allows for different intercept and slopes based upon the neighborhood. The resultant model can be seen in Fig ~\ref{fig:NBLRM}.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Model Metrics}
Model metrics can be seen in Table ~\ref{tab:A1Results}.
\subsubsection{Adj R\textsuperscript{2}} 
\paragraph{Adjusted $R^2$} obtained for this model is 0.53.
\subsubsection{Internal Press} 
\paragraph{Press} obtained by this model is $1.96E11$.
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Parameters}
\subsubsection{Estimates}
\paragraph{} The parameter estimates can be seen in Table ~\ref{tab:SMM}. With these estimates a separate equation can be written for each neighborhood to predict sale price based on living area.
\begin{eqnarray*}
SalePrice &=& 74982 + 54.93(GrLivArea) - 55776(BrkSide) - 30274(Edwards) + \\
& & 33.31(GrLivArea)(BrkSide) + 8.24(GrLivArea)(Edwards)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\paragraph{North Ames}
\begin{eqnarray*}
SalePrice &=& 74982 + 54.93(GrLivArea)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\paragraph{Edwards}
\begin{eqnarray*}
SalePrice &=& 74982 + 54.93(GrLivArea) - 30274 + 8.24(GrLivArea)\\
&=& 44708 + 63.17(GrLivArea)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\paragraph{Brookside}
\begin{eqnarray*}
SalePrice &=& 74982 + 54.93(GrLivArea) - 55776 + 33.31(GrLivArea)\\
&=& 19206 + 88.24(GrLivArea)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\subsubsection{Interpretation}
\paragraph{$\beta_0$}The intercept in this model provides an estimate (74982) of the sale price of a home in North Ames (reference neighborhood) with a living area of zero. Of course, this is extrapolation and does not have a clear, practical meaning.
\paragraph{$\beta_1$}For each 100 square foot increase in the living area of a home in North Ames, the estimated sale price increases \$54.93.
\paragraph{$\beta_2$}This is the adjustment of the intercept for a home in Brookside with respect to a home in North Ames. For a living area of zero, the home in Brookside has an estimated sale price of \$55,776 less than a home in North Ames.
\paragraph{$\beta_3$}This is the adjustment of the intercept for a home in Edwards with respect to a home in North Ames. For a living area of zero, the home in Edwards has an estimated sale price of \$30,274 less than a home in North Ames.
\paragraph{$\beta_4$}For each 100 square foot increase in the living area of a home in Brookside, the estimated sale price increases \$33 from the change with the home in North Ames.
\paragraph{$\beta_5$}For each 100 square foot increase in the living area of a home in Edwards, the estimated sale price increases \$8 from the change with the home in North Ames.
\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals}
The confidence intervals for the estimates can be seen in Table ~\ref{tab:SMM}. 
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Conclusion}
\paragraph{} The square feet of above ground living area is a statistically significant feature to use to predict the sale price of homes in the North Ames, Edwards, and Brookside neighborhoods of Ames, Iowa. The existing sale prices of homes that have sold in these neighborhoods that are under \$300,000 and underwent a normal sales condition meet all the assumptions required to generate an appropriate linear regression model. We also examined the differences in predicted prices in these three neighborhoods and determined that the sale prices of homes in each of these neighborhoods do differ from each other. Homes in North Ames under 1600 square feet are predicted to sell for the highest price as compared to the other two neighborhoods. The price per square foot in Brookside increases at the highest rate of the three neighborhoods. Homes greater than approximately 1000 square feet in Brookside are predicted to sell for higher prices than comparable homes in Edwards. Homes greater than approximately 1600 square feet in Brookside are predicted to sell for higher prices than comparable homes in North Ames. Homes in the Edwards neighborhood are predicted to sell for the lowest price of all three neighbor hoods with the exception of homes that are smaller than 1000 square feet.
%------------------------------------------------

\section{Analysis Question 2}
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Restatement of Problem}
\paragraph{} Build the most predictive model for sales prices of homes in all of Ames Iowa.  This includes all neighborhoods. Your group is limited to only the techniques we have learned in 6371 (no random forests or other methods we have not yet covered).  Specifically, you should produce 4 models: one from forward selection, one from backwards elimination, one from stepwise selection, and one that you build custom.  The custom model could be one of the three preceding models or one that you build by adding or subtracting variables at your will.  Generate an adjusted R2, CV Press and Kaggle Score for each of these models and clearly describe which model you feel is the best in terms of being able to predict future sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. 
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Model Selection}
\subsubsection{Forward}
\begin{eqnarray*}
SalePrice &=& -1271664 + 648.153(YearBuilt) + 47.049(TotalBsmtSF) \\

& & + 62871(BsmtQual\_Ex)
\end{eqnarray*}
The SAS code for the forward model can be found in Listing~\ref{lst:Forward} of Appendix ~\ref{sec:Analysis2}.
The fit diagnostics and residuals by regressors for sale price can be seen in Fig ~\ref{fig:A2FWAss}. A scatterplot of the predicted values vs. the sale price using the features obtained by the forward selection model can be seen in Fig ~\ref{fig:A2FWscatt}.
\paragraph{Linearity} Visual tests support assumptions of linearity. There is no evidence to suggest that these data are not linear based on the scatterplot in Fig ~\ref{fig:A2FWscatt}.
\paragraph{Constant Variance} Examining Fig ~\ref{fig:A2FWAss} supports a loose random scatter of points around the origin. 
\paragraph{Normality} Visual analysis of histograms and q-q plots in Fig ~\ref{fig:A2FWQQ} suggests normality of the data. Additionally the random cloud scatter plotted in Fig ~\ref{fig:A2FWAss} supports the normality assumption. Left and right leaning trailing tails in the q-q plot does suggest that outliers on both ends may not meet the normality assumption. We will address this in later analysis.
\paragraph{Independence} Century21 Ames indicated all samples are unique sales in a free housing market, supporting assumptions of independence. 
\paragraph{Outliers and Influential Points}

\section{Understanding Text}

\subsection{How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?}

%------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Suppose ``chuck" implies throwing.}

According to the Associated Press (1988), a New York Fish and Wildlife technician named Richard Thomas calculated the volume of dirt in a typical 25--30 foot (7.6--9.1 m) long woodchuck burrow and had determined that if the woodchuck had moved an equivalent volume of wood, it could move ``about \textbf{700 pounds (320 kg)} on a good day, with the wind at his back".

%------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Suppose ``chuck" implies vomiting.}

A woodchuck can ingest 361.92 cm\textsuperscript{3} (22.09 cu in) of wood per day. Assuming immediate expulsion on ingestion with a 5\% retainment rate, a woodchuck could chuck \textbf{343.82 cm\textsuperscript{3}} of wood per day.

%------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Bonus: suppose there is no woodchuck.}
